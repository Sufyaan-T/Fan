# Fan
App for Computer Science.
It's an app designed so you can turn a fan on and off remotely using the internet. It was a project for my computer science unit in sixth form and designed it in Android Studio. I also used Kotlin juxtaposed to using Java considering Kotlin use is becoming way more widespread for Android developers to use. Although, the functionality of the app is great you still need to have the arduino set up and the code on there.
